## About

NVBeacon gives you a fast view of one or more remote NVIDIA GPU servers from the macOS menu bar without keeping Terminal open.

It connects over `ssh`, runs `nvidia-smi` on each enabled target server, and turns the result into a compact menu bar summary plus a detailed popover UI with GPU utilization, memory, process details, and job alerts. It is built for people who regularly ask:

- Is the server busy right now?
- Which GPU is running my job?
- Which process is running on that GPU?
- Did my training job finish?
- Has a watched GPU stayed idle long enough to reuse?

## Features

- Native macOS menu bar UI with compact status text or icon-only mode
- Remote NVIDIA GPU monitoring over `ssh` using `nvidia-smi`
- Multiple server targets with per-server enable/disable, authentication, connection reuse, and remote command settings
- Per-GPU utilization, memory, temperature, and process count
- On-demand process details with user, PID, memory, and command preview
- Automatic detection and highlighting of your own remote SSH user processes and GPUs
- Job completion alerts through macOS Notification Center when watched GPU processes exit
- GPU idle notifications with configurable idle duration and memory threshold
- Configurable busy GPU detection based on active processes, memory usage, or utilization
- Built-in update checks using Sparkle, the standard macOS update framework
- Optional launch at login using the standard macOS login item mechanism
- Import from local `~/.ssh/config`
- SSH key authentication and password-based authentication
- English / Korean UI with a `System` language option
- Light / dark / system appearance support

## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask jaein4722/tap/nvbeacon
```

### GitHub Releases

Download the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jaein4722/NVBeacon/releases).

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest `NVBeacon-<version>.dmg` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jaein4722/NVBeacon/releases).
2. Open the DMG.
3. Drag `NVBeacon.app` into `Applications`.
4. Launch the app from `Applications`.
5. If macOS blocks the app because it cannot verify the developer, open `System Settings > Privacy & Security` and choose `Open Anyway`.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or later
- SSH access from your Mac to the target server
- `nvidia-smi` available on the remote host

## Quick Start

1. Launch NVBeacon.
2. Right-click the menu bar item and open `Settings…`.
3. Add a server target directly or import a saved host from `~/.ssh/config`.
4. Add more server targets if you want one menu bar summary across multiple machines.
5. Choose the authentication method for each server.
6. Allow notifications if you want job completion or GPU idle alerts.
7. Left-click the menu bar item to open the GPU popover.
8. Open the `About` tab when you want to check for a newer release manually.

All settings apply automatically. There is no separate apply button.

## Notifications

NVBeacon supports two kinds of work alerts for remote GPU jobs:

- `Process Exit`: watch a running GPU process and get notified when it really exits
- `GPU Idle`: star a GPU and get notified when it stays idle long enough for the next job

You can manage notification permission, active watches, and recent notification history from the `Notifications` tab in Settings.

## Settings Overview

NVBeacon uses a native macOS-style settings window with these sections:

- `General`: server list, per-server connection/authentication, polling, startup, busy GPU detection, update preferences
- `Notifications`: permission, test notification, active watches, history, idle thresholds
- `Appearance`: theme, language, Dock icon, menu bar summary, popover behavior
- `Advanced`: remote command override
- `About`: version, links, runtime summary, and current configuration

## Language Support

The interface can be set to:

- `System`
- `English`
- `Korean`

`System` follows the current macOS language. Unsupported system languages fall back to English.

## Notes

- NVBeacon uses your local SSH setup directly, including `~/.ssh/config`.
- In key-based mode, background polling does not read from Keychain.
- In password-based mode, each server password is stored in macOS Keychain and unlocked into memory once per app session to avoid repeated Keychain prompts during polling.
- The first time you switch to password-based mode, NVBeacon shows a security warning because this mode is less secure than SSH keys.
- If the remote non-interactive shell has a limited `PATH`, set `Remote Command` to an absolute path such as `/usr/bin/nvidia-smi`.
- Public DMG downloads may still trigger a Gatekeeper warning unless the release is signed and notarized.
- Launch at login is only available from a packaged app bundle, not `swift run`.
- Short release notes are tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
